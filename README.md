# Serato-2-OBS
A dirty and ugly solution to semi-automate getting the currently playing Serato song to OBS

# What is this ?
I am doing a live DJ stream with a friend, I want to have the artist and song on screen but I don't wanna spend 3 hours updating notepad
so I wrote a terrible piece of python code that runs a flask service within WSL on his laptop and I run the "selector" program on my laptop that retrieves the info from flask and writes to files that OBS then uses to populate the screen

# How it works
.... in a bad graph

# How to use 
..... don't 

# How to use Part 2
* on the machine running Serato, run the flask service within WSL
* On the machine running OBS, run the selector from within OBS
* Have OBS read the artist and song info from the files generated by the selector

# Q&A

### I am only using one computer, why do I need to run flask and have 2 programs ?
Because I didn't spend the extra 15 minutes to combine the two

### This is the ugliest code I have seen in a while
Not a question, but yes. It is

### Why did you publish this ?
I am hoping this could be a jumping off point for someone else to make something better   
Which is why the code is so heavily commented to explain what I am trying to do there

### I just want the data, not the selector and flask
just run the flask service with a --data flag, it will return a list and won't even import flask
